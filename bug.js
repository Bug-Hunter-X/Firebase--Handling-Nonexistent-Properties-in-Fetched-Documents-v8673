The Firebase SDK may throw an error if it attempts to access a nonexistent property in a fetched document.  This can happen if you're expecting certain fields to always exist but they're missing in some documents.  For example, if you're trying to access `data.name` but some documents don't have a `name` field, you might encounter a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.
